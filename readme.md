We are resubmitting the network, the self-eval and the weight.
    - `project1_model.py`: We modified our network to run without the need for extra packages with native pytorch.
    - `hyperparams.pt`: The hyperparameters are stored also as a .pt, so we are submitting this too.
    - `project1_model.pt`: We extracted previous checkpoint format back into .pt.
    - `self_eval.py`: We used a slightly different normalization.
